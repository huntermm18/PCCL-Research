Getting Started:
    Add openAI key to keys.py
    Set parameters in _parameters.py


Docker container:
    run "sh docker-script.sh" with the optional gpu number parameter after


Language Model:
    The language model that will be used in the pipeline is defined in _parameters.py
    if USE_OPENAI == True then the model will be either text-davinci-003 or gpt-3.5-turbo (based on USE_TURBO)
    if USE_OPENAI == False then instead of API calls to OpenAI the calls will be made to the local server on Sivri and will use the model from the MODEL variable


Pipeline:
    Run "simple_stories.py"
    Run "strans.py" (make sure at least this one is run in the docker container)
    Run "vis.py" which generates the final plots and outputs them to the result_viz folder. The plotly charts will be HTML files
